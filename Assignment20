1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?
Ans->
      1:  CREATE View Dailyorders as 
          SELECT Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate FROM Orders;

      4:  CREATE View Nullcities as
          SELECT snum, sname, city FROM Salespeople WHERE city is NULL
          OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;


2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions.
   This view will include only the snum and comm fields. 
   Through this view, someone could enter or change commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20.
Ans->
      CREATE View Commisions as
      SELECT Snum, Comm FROM salespeople
      WHERE Comm BETWEEN 0.10 AND 0.20
      with check option;
