1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
   excluded from the date field.

Ans->   CREATE TABLE orders(onum int(4), snum int(4), cnum int(4), odate date NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (onum,snum,cnum));



2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
   between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).

Ans->   CREATE TABLE salespeople(comm int(4) default 10,snum int(4) PRIMARY KEY, sname varchar(25) CHECK (substr(upper(sname),1,1) BETWEEN 'A' and 'M'));



3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, andthe cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.

Ans->   CREATE TABLE order(onum int(4) NOT NULL, cnum int(4) NOT NULL, snum int(4) NOT NULL, CHECK (onum > cnum AND cnum > snum));
