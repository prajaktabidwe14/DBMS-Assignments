1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater
   will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

Ans->      SELECT cname, city, 'High Rating' rating FROM customers WHERE rating >= 200
                                                             UNION
           SELECT cname, city, 'Low Rating' rating FROM customers WHERE rating < 200;



2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order.
   Put the results in alphabetical order.

Ans->     SELECT sname,snum FROM Salespeople 
          WHERE snum in (SELECT snum FROM orders WHERE cnum in 
         (SELECT cnum FROM orders GROUP BY cnum HAVING count(cnum) > 1));


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose;
   and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
  (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)

Ans->    SELECT snum FROM salespeople WHERE city = 'San Jose'
                                          UNION
         SELECT snum FROM customers WHERE city = 'San Jose'
                                          UNION
         SELECT snum FROM orders WHERE odate = '1990-10-03';
